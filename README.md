<!-- ## Centering Learning and Equity in Assessment
_Tapia 2021 Workshop_ -->

### Abstract

This hands-on workshop is intended to provide faculty and graduate students teaching computer science (CS) courses an opportunity to modify their courses to better motivate and engage students via centering learning and equity in their courses’ assessment. Participants will learn about various assessment methods, explore their applications to various CS courses, and modify a syllabus or assignment for one of their courses based. The workshop will be supported with a workbook (guide) developed by the presenters so participants can continue to engage in their learning and course modification beyond the conclusion of the workshop. Participants will need to bring the syllabus and 1-2 assignments for the course they are interested in revising. Limited to 20 participants.

### Agenda

__Introduction: Grading for learning__ (10 mins)
During the first part of the workshop, we will discuss assessment from the assignment level to the course level and how it can align with learning and equity. We will outline key terms and discuss how assessment can encourage learning and support equity.

__Proven Applications: Syllabus and assignment examples__ (20 min)
Participants will practice applying the new terminology and theoretical grounding by studying examples of existing course syllabi and assignments.

__Initial Course Modifying__ (10 min)
Participants will begin to modify their courses to center learning and equity. During this time, participants should tackle one specific change—either at the course level (syllabus) or at the assignment level.

__Peer feedback__ (10 min)
Participants will share their course modifications with each other in small groups and provide feedback for areas of improvement.

__Reflecting: Group Discussion__ (15 min)
As a whole group, participants will reflect on their modifications, the feedback they received, and the questions they have for moving forward. Presenters will pose reflective exercises and answer participants’ questions.

__Revisions and Next Steps__ (5 min)
After hearing from their peers, participants will have the opportunity to revise their modifications and plan out their ‘next steps’. 

__Closing__ (5 min)
Presenters will answer any final questions and share the workbook (guide) they have developed so participants can continue to engage in their learning and course modification beyond the conclusion of the workshop.
